# OS_Programming-Assignments
OS Programming Assignments done for Prof Rincon COSC 3360
The idea for these assignment was to implement a Rate Monolithic Scheduling Diagram through various different ways. 
# The first implementation 
The first implentation utilizes forking to process the data and print out the data.
# The second implementation 
The second implementatio utilizes servers and clients, where the client sends the data to the server. The server then processes the data and sends it back to the client, where it is printed. 
# The third implementation 
The third implementation utilizes mutexes to produce the Rate Monolithic Scheduling Diagram.
